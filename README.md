This is the skin EdK (Etoso de Keith), originally a mod of the WordPress classic theme that was heavily changed, later ported to b2evolution.  I use it on my blog and you can use it on yours too, though some things specific to my blog may be in the code and you may need to manually edit it to your liking.
